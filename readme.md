This is a photo scanning utilties app that helps with digitizing old photos. It lets the user scan multiple photos at once, by automatically cropping photos detected and saves them as seperate image files. It is very basic at the moment, but it was good enough to get the job done in my case.

Built with PyQt for Ui, OpenCv for image processing, and [https://www.naps2.com/doc/command-line](NAPS2) to interface with the printer/scanner. To use this program, it is important to add "naps2.console.exe" to the environment variable, as the cli is used to interface with naps2.
